						Our Story
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant='body1' className='my-4'>
						Hey, thanks for checking out the Trick Book! I’ve made this
						originally as a tool to keep track of my tricks for action sports
						and other hobbies in a place that was outside my notes app.
						Somewhere I could keep everything organized, keep myself
						accountable, and remember the trick ideas I had. That was a few
						years ago, since then I’ve had a bigger vision for this platform.
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant='body1' className='my-4'>
						I believe that any big idea, if it’s going to last - it needs to be
						built on a strong foundation of values. These are the values that
						the Trick Book embodies:
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant='body1' className='my-4'>
						<ul>
							<li>Giving back to community</li>
							<li>Never giving up</li>
							<li>Respect gets Respect</li>
							<li>Constant improvement</li>
							<li>Mastery</li>
							<li>Humbleness</li>
						</ul>
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant='body1' className='my-4'>
						If you’re into action sports I’m sure that some of these values
						resonate with you. With all of that being said, let’s continue to
						unveil the bigger vision for The Trick Book.
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant='body1' className='my-4'>
						More than just a tool for listing tricks, The Trick Book is setting
						out to be a directory of tricks and a historical reference. Sort of
						like a Wikipedia for action sports. We’re on a mission to collect
						data about each trick from each of the major disciplines like
						Skateboarding, Surfing, BMX, Snowboarding, Wakeboarding,
						Rollerblading, Scootering, Mountain Biking and more. We’ll start
						creating a “Trick Wiki” on our website which will provide details
						and history about the trick, links to the trick being done, and some
						popular tutorial videos for each trick. Once we have established a
						good data set of tricks on our website, we will release the Trick
						Wiki into our mobile app as well.
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant='body1' className='my-4'>
						The Trick Book will also set out on its own journey, through myself
						and my network of peers in action sports, to produce original
						tutorials for tricks. We may release a number of these tutorials for
						free, but this will likely end up being a paid access feature. Time
						is money people! One thing I do want to establish, is that while we
						will offer a subscription type service or some paid features, we
						will also always maintain a lot of our information free for public
						use.
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant='body1' className='my-4'>
						I also want to emphasize that this platform will only start to gain
						momentum from active users. I am only one person, I can’t document
						every detail about every trick myself. That’s why we’re going for a
						more “Wikipedia” like approach. The Trick Wiki will be a community
						maintained ecosystem. Active users are the ones who are going to
						fuel the momentum of the Trick Book in the long run.
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant='body1' className='my-4'>
						Thank you for taking the time to check out The Trick Book, my name
						is Wes Huber. If you have any questions, suggestions, or if you want
						to get in touch please reach out to info@thetrickbook.com or fill
						out our Contact Form. We’ll get back to you!

						Peace ✌️
