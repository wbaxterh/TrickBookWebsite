## The scoop

The scoop is the first thing you'll want to learn. You want to use your back foot to pop the board up and slide it back towards you to get the board to do a 180 degree rotation. Practice this with one foot on the board and one foot off.

## Apply the scoop with both feet

Now, with both feet on the board, apply the scoop and combine it with a jump motion. You can jump to the side of your board if you are afraid to land on it at first. Practice this in the grass first. You can also just use a skateboard deck without the trucks to practice this. Or a deck on the trampoline helps too!

Once you feel comfortable enough try landing on the board with one foot, and then with both feet.

## Take it to the pavement / concrete

Now that you've practiced in the grass or on a trampoline and landed with both feet on the board, you should feel comfortable enough to take this to the streets. I would start rolling at a slow pace, perform the shuv-it and try landing with just your front foot and just your back foot to get comfortable on where the board will be.

## Where should I look?

When starting out you can look down at the board, but you really to be looking ahead at where you're going. You can look down at the board to spot your landing.

## How do I make it look cool?

Once your comfortable with the pop shove it, try doing it with a tailgrab. Try kicking your back foot out behind you after you scoop and catching with just the front foot, the "yo" shove it.

## Conclusion

Those are the steps for getting a good pop shuv-it, now go out and practice and have fun with it!
