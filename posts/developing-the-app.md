## About the Author - Wes Huber

I am deeply passionate about action sports and also hold a degree in computer science. For years, I've been using my web development skills to fund my travel adventures, shredding across various terrains and learning new tricks. But it was always in the back of my mind—why not align my programming skills with my passion?

## The Inception

The idea came to me during multiple contests and video sessions where I found myself jotting down lists of tricks. It occurred to me—why not create an app for this? Thus, the idea for The Trick Book app was born.

## The Journey Begins

Two years ago, I enrolled in a React Native course and began the initial phase of building the app. Life happened, the project went into hibernation, but the spark remained.

## Rekindling in 2023

At the start of this year, I decided it was finally time to bring my vision to life. I picked up where I left off, fine-tuned the app, and finally brought it to the App Store.

## Future Plans

The journey is far from over. I have big plans for the app:

- Launch it on Google Play for Android users.
- Create our own trick database.
- Add tutorial videos to help users master new tricks.
- Evolve it into a social network and community hub for action sports enthusiasts.

So, whether you're an experienced boarder or just getting started, stay tuned. There's much more to come!
