*By Riders. For Riders.*

## The tools changed. So we built our own platform.

Here's the thing about 2026: with tools like Claude Code, it's never been easier for *anyone* to build *anything*.

You don't need a $50M seed round. You don't need a team of 200 engineers. You don't need permission from Silicon Valley.

You just need a vision and the will to ship.

So we built TrickBook — a social platform for action sports, made by people who actually ride.

---

## Why now?

Because skaters, snowboarders, surfers, BMXers — we've been posting clips on platforms that don't give a damn about us.

Instagram's algorithm buries your content unless you pay. TikTok is a slot machine designed to hijack your dopamine. Facebook is... well, it's Facebook.

**These corporations don't have our best interests at heart.** They have shareholders.

We wanted something different. Something that actually serves the community.

---

## What we built

**A feed that feels like TikTok or Reels** — but for tricks, not thirst traps. Share clips. Get hyped. Discover new riders.

**Messaging on the caliber of WhatsApp** — DMs, group chats, crew coordination. Plan sessions without leaving the app.

**A map to pin and save spots** — like Google Maps, but for ledges, rails, parks, and secret spots. Share with your crew or keep them lowkey.

**Trickipedia** — a living encyclopedia of tricks. Learn the progression. Track what you've landed. See what's next.

All of it. In one place. Built for us.

## The real question

Who do you want to win?

**Meta?** A company that makes billions selling your attention to advertisers?

Or a **By Riders, For Riders** platform — built by someone who actually skates, for people who actually ride?

---

## Join the community

**The TrickBook** is live. The social update is here.

This isn't just an app. It's a statement:

> We can build our own tools. We don't need their platforms. The community is the product — not you.

See you in the feed. 🛹
