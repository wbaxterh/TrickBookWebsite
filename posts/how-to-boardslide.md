## Prerequisites

Before learning how to boardslide, you should already have a few tricks under your belt.

- The Ollie
- The Frontside 180

## Practice popping onto a feature

It's important with boardslides to start small and work your way up. I recommend finding a small parking curb or similar obstacle to practice ollieing onto the center of you board. If you can pivot off great! If not, no worries, the main goal of this exercise is to get comfortable ollieing onto the center of your board.

## Now practice the slide on a small ledge or rail

Now that you're comfortable ollieing onto a feature, it's time to try it rolling. Roll at a slow, comfortable speed and ollie on to a small rail or ledge. First start with just hitting the end of the rail or ledge. Try changing up your speed, a lot of times more speed is helpful for boardslides.

## How do I land?

You can land either fakie or regular, whichever comes more naturally to you. All you need to do to land the boardslide is give your board a nudge at the end of the rail to push it back to regular or over to fakie. You should have enough time in the air to get the board straight and land on the bolts.

## Where do I look?

When performing the boardslide it's important to focus on the end of the rail as the target of where you are going. Before you ollie on you should be in line to target the end of the rail, you can line yourself up by looking at the end of the rail. When it's time to ollie on you cna focus on your ollie and the rail in front of you, but it's important to maintain focus on your destination, the end of the rail.

## Conclusion

Those are the steps for getting a boardslide, now go out and practice and have fun with it!
